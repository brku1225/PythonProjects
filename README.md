# PythonProjects
Projects I've worked on in python.

game.py is a very simple action game, where the player can either attack or defend against a monster on each turn. The attack does a random amount of damage. 

labyrinth.py is just a puzzle game, getting from one point to another. The player is marked as 'p' and the finish is marked as an 'F'. I have only made two differemt maps.
